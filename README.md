# student-application

# This application was created in February 2016.
# It is a simple Java desktop student application with a GPA calculator and Monthly calendar.
# While this application does have some errors, it was my first exposure to a real computer science project.
# I created this application in the hope that future students could use it to calculate their GPA and track their schedule. 
# To use the application, download the jar file in the dist folder and click on it to run the application.
